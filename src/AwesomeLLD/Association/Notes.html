    Modularity, in general, refers to the degree to which a system's components
    may be separated and recombined. It's a design principle that involves
    breaking down complex systems into smaller, independent modules, each with
    a specific function, which can then be combined to form a more complex whole.
    This approach offers numerous benefits, including simplified design, easier
    development, enhanced flexibility, and improved maintainability.
